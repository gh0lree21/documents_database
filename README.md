# Overview

This is a web app. Specifically it is a form which is built on HTML on the front end and Nodejs for the back end. When you have all of the files on your computer, 
this program creates a web server from the command line. There is a log in the terminal to tell you what url to visit to try the features of the app. 

This project was an adventure. It was my first real experience with Javascript as well as servers. Overall, I love the idea of Nodejs. I enjoyed 
trying to create the backend of something that I take for granted all the time on the web. 

I decided to tackle this after my father had a conversation from someone in industry who said gave some tips on what skills are needed in the market right now. Nodejs and React were two of those. I did not know what I was getting into when I started this journey, but I quite enjoyed my work in Node (even if it didn't seem to amount to much to me.) I learned lots and documented many of the helpful sources I found. One thing I learned, is that it's okay to dive into libraries when you're learning a new language or skill. I was trying to create the whole program with vanilla Javascript and it proved to be much more verbose when compared to something like express.

# Web Pages

The first web page, that is designed to be sent to the user when a person tries to access the server is a simple work order form. In theory, once the form has been submitted, the page dynamically changes and thanks the user. 
The most dynamic part of either page would the 'success' message in the second 'page.'

# Future Work

* Attach a database (I already started the process; start over or try MongoDB).
* Connect the two HTML pages, or make the one page dynamic using scripts.
* Be able to parse different kinds of data from the user.
